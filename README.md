# Reflection
## Introduction
My website is created based on a rhythm game that I like to played whenever I have free time - Osu!, particularly focusing on different game modes and providing an engaging user experience. The goal of this website was to design a visually appealing and user-friendly website that effectively communicates the unique features of each game mode.

## Development Process
Using the original low-fidelity prototypes created from previous assignment,
<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img src="img/Low-fidelity prototype.webp">
</p>
I will then leverage the use of HTML and CSS codes structuring and styling the website respectively. This website consists of three main pages: **Home**, **About**, and **Demo**. Effectively, each page was designed to provide specific information about the game and its modes. To be able to do this, I used various tools and resources to aid in the development process including online tutorials, W3C documentation, and community forums (StackOverFlow, Reddit, etc). By taking adventages of it, I can understand best practices and troubleshoot any issues that might arose during my website implementation progress.

## Design Decisions
One of the key design decisions for my website was to create a consistent and intuitive navigation system. Therefore, I have choose to make an horizontal navigation bar layout. It will be placed at the top of each page including links to each of the metioned pages as well as links to the GitHub repository and the official Osu! website. By doing this, it will ensures that users can easily navigate between pages and access additional resources. Besides, another important design decision was the use of images and text to convey information about each game mode. For example, within **About** page, each game mode is presented with an image and a brief description. This visual approach quickly supports readers in understand the unique features of each mode. Not just that, I also focused on making the website responsive to assure that it looks good on both desktop and mobile devices. This was achieved by using CSS flexible grid layouts. Moreover, the use of viewport units (vw) for image sizes guarantee that it will be scaled appropriately on different screen sizes.

## Challenges and Solutions
One of the main challenges I faced was ensuring that the website was responsive and looked good on all devices. Initially, the layout was not adjusting properly on smaller screens, which made the content difficult to read. Luckily, I came across an blog that talks about the advantage of using flexible box container layout approach in CSS. After reading the blog and trying to apply the method to my website, I can see that it allows me to create flexible and responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes without the need for media queries.

## Learning and Improvement
Throughout this assignment, I have learned a lot about web development, especially in using HTML and CSS to crate a wonderful static website that meet my desires. Not stopping there, I have gained a deeper understanding of how to create responsive layouts without having to play around many hacky methods that potentially make the website much harder to be maintain in near feature. Importantly, I also get to learn the importance of testing the website on different devices (laptop, desktops, presentation screens, etc) to ensure a consistent user experience. However, one area I would like to improve in the future is my use of CSS selectors. Initially, I relied heavily on class selectors, which for now it is fairly easy to understand and navigate through as the project is not at decent complexity yet. Nevertheless, I realized that using more specific selectors could make CSS coding more efficient and easier to maintain. From there, I planned to explore more advanced CSS techniques such as using attribute selectors and pseudo-classes so that I can improve my coding practices. Adding to it, one more improvement I would like to make is to add more interactive elements to the website. For example, I could incorporate JavaScript to create animations onto `<h1>` text and `<img>` imagesin **Home** page that can enhance the user experience by a whole lots. This would not only make the website more engaging but also demonstrate a broader range of web development skills.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project was a valuable learning experience that allowed me to apply my knowledge of HTML and CSS to create a functional and visually appealing website. The development process was challenging but rewarding in which I am proud of the final product. The website effectively communicates the unique features of the Osu! rhythm game and provides an engaging user experience. I am confident that the skills and knowledge I gained from this project will be beneficial in future web development endeavors. I am looking forward to continuing to learn and grow as a web developer and to take on more complex projects in the future.
