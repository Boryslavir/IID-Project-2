                            combo, and timing with bonuses during Kiai Time.

                            This game mode got inspired by a hidden mode unlocked from a game named <strong>rhythm-it
                                (or ruv-it)</strong> which first explored in 2001. Besides, it has a fairly simple
                            gameplay where players control a character that catches falling fruit in tune with the beat.
                            The game features various types of fruits, fruit trails, bananas, and hyperfruits, each with
                            unique scoring and gameplay mechanics. Moreover, the zoom size of the playfield is based on
                            Circle Size (CS) settings, and the catcher can move left and right to catch fruits. Scoring
                            is based on the number of fruits caught, combo, and accuracy, with a health bar that
                            depletes on misses.
